# Petition

On the 6th week of Full Stack JavaScript Web Development coding bootcamp at SPICED Academy, I built a petition to outlaw pineapple as pizza topping. It has a fully responsive web design and can be signed in a browser or on a touch screen device.

### Users can:

* register and log in (passwords are hashed and salted),
* edit their profile,
* sign the petition and delete their signature,
* see other users who have signed the petition.

### Technologies used:

* Node.js and Express.js
* Express Handlebars
* PostgreSQL Database
* Canvas

While working on the project, I became more comfortable with Express.js and Express Handlebar. I also had an opportunity to practice making a responsive design and figure out how to make it possible to sign the petition on a touch screen.
